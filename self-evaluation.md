# Self-evaluation

1. I'm feeling pretty confident with this portion of it. Replit is super useful. That's helped me practice a lot more efficiently.
2. No additional learning needed here. I think some of the other content today is going to be more difficult for me.
3. I don't have any questions about arrays at this point.
